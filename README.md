## Building the Kernel

### Prerequisites
- GCC cross-compiler (or native GCC with 32-bit support)
- NASM assembler
- GNU Make
- QEMU (optional, for testing)

### Build Instructions
```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install gcc nasm make qemu-system-x86

# Build the kernel
make clean
make

# Test in QEMU (if available)
make run
```

### Build Output
- `build/kernel.bin` - The compiled kernel binary
- `build/kernel.iso` - Bootable ISO image (if GRUB tools available)

## Architecture

### Memory Layout
- **Kernel Space**: 0xC0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF (1GB)
- **User Space**: 0x00000000 - 0xBFFFFFFF (3GB)
- **Heap**: Starts at 0x00100000 (1MB)
- **Stack**: 16KB per process

### Process Model
- Cooperative multitasking with round-robin scheduler
- Process Control Blocks (PCB) with state management
- Simple process creation and termination

### System Calls
| Number | Name     | Description                |
|--------|----------|----------------------------|
| 1      | exit     | Terminate process          |
| 2      | write    | Write data to output       |
| 3      | read     | Read data from input       |
| 4      | getpid   | Get process ID             |
| 5      | malloc   | Allocate memory            |
| 6      | free     | Free allocated memory      |
| 7      | ps       | List processes             |
| 8      | meminfo  | Show memory information    |

## Shell Commands

The kernel includes a fully interactive shell with these commands:

### System Information
- `about` - Display kernel information and capabilities
- `uptime` - Show system uptime
- `meminfo` - Display memory usage statistics
- `ps` - List running processes

### File Operations
- `ls` - List files in the filesystem
- `cat <filename>` - Display file contents
- Example: `cat readme.txt`

### Network Commands
- `ifconfig` - Show network interfaces
- `ping <ip>` - Ping a network address
- `netstat` - Display network statistics

### Utility Commands
- `help` - Show all available commands
- `clear` - Clear the screen
- `echo <text>` - Echo text to output
- `test` - Run system tests
- `reboot` - Restart the system
- `exit` - Exit the shell

## File System

The kernel includes a simple in-memory file system with these features:
- Up to 64 files
- Maximum file size: 4KB
- Basic operations: create, read, write, delete, list
- Pre-loaded with sample files (readme.txt, version.txt, help.txt)

## Networking

Basic networking stack includes:
- Network interface management
- Simple packet handling
- ARP table management
- Basic socket interface (placeholder)
- Loopback and Ethernet interface simulation

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. **New System Call**: Add to `src/syscall.c` and update the dispatcher
2. **New Command**: Add to `src/shell.c` command table
3. **New Driver**: Create in `src/` and add initialization to `kernel_main()`
